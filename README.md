## Overview
This project was inspired by the rapid growth and global popularity of TikTok. We aim to provide insights into the content and user engagement on the platform, enabling content creators and businesses to better tailor their strategies for more effective engagement.

In this project, we have analyzed the data scraped from TikTok using a variety of tools. We have used clustering algorithms, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to categorize the content into different topics based on hashtags and video captions. Our study also involves exploring the characteristics that influence the popularity of a video.
